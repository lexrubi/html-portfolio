<h1>The best movies about the Space and Aliens, accoring to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies about Space an Aliens</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Arrival by Dennis Villenueve (2016)</h3>
<p>This is probably my favorite one because it´s based on a really good book named Arrival as same as the movie, writed by Ted Chaing,<br /> which is one of the most popular writers in China.</p>
<p>The soundtrack of this movie is just a masterpiece, and the story is incredible.</p>

<h3>Interstellar by Christopher Nolan (2014)</h3>
<p>This one is a really good story as Arrival, maybe not too god but it is a good one. The really interesting thing about this movie is not his story,<br /> it´s his soundtrack.</p>

<H3>Oblivion by Joseph Kosinski (2013)</H3>
<p>This could be my favorite too, I cant´t decide me.</p>
<P>The soundtrack is also a masterpiece but I thinhk that the reason why it could be my favorite movie it´s because something sentimental, 
<br /> I saw this movie when I wasn´t in love and this is a story about love and I used to think that one day a could have a love story like the story of this movie. 
<br />Now I´m in love and maybe that´s the reason why I love this movie too much.</P>
